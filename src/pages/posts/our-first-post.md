Starting things from scratch is scary and difficult. We went from having only our very close friends following us to growing an audience of 2k people in less than a year. Special thanks to all our followers! 2020 is around the corner and we want to expand and create more content.

A picture from June 23rd with 207 followers. Six months later the page grew and we evolved the [@bestfoodindallas](https://www.instagram.com/bestfoodindallas/) brand. At this time we were learning how to take pictures because we felt it's unfair to the food to be judged based on the pictures we take. A cool story was the post next to the coffee place where we recorded a man making elotes in Deep Ellum which the video went somewhat viral. Thank you guys for following our journey in finding the most interesting places in Dallas. We will continue to work hard and provide the best for our followers.
