Welcoming 2020 with our first post about our personal top taco list for you to try! (The list is an unordered list.)

## La Salsa Verde Taqueria

Before we started blogging this spot has been our all time personal favorite. The main attraction is the "Fajiqueso" tacos. A combination of melted cheese and fajita along with three different types of salsas to choose from. The meat with cheese combination is something special due to the richness of the flavor. A bonus is that every single time we've been here they have never disappointed and their cooking has been on point!

## Chilangos Tacos

Mexico city street style tacos is what Chilango's tacos are known for. They have proven to carry that style over to their food and also incorporated it into the theme of the restaurant. The tortilla and the meat flavor is very different compared to other places. Read about our [experience here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B55jNdEnZFe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

### El Atoron

A small hole in the wall place hidden in East Dallas. This place is known for their Mexico City style tacos and tortas. From the first bite, the taco literally melts in your mouth. The combination of a handmade tortilla, carne asada and salsa is truly amazing! Something that caught our attention was the flavor of the tortilla. Normally people don't focus much on the tortilla but in this case the tortilla made the taco experience so much better. You can taste the freshness of the taco and it simply leaves you wanting more.
