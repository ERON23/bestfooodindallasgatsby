Welcoming 2020 with our first post about our personal top 5 taco list for you to try!. The list is an unordered list.

### **La Salsa Verde Taqueria**

Before we started blogging this spot has been my all time personal favorite. The main attraction is the "Fajiqueso" tacos. A combination of melted cheese and fajita along with 3 different types of salsas to choose from. The meat with cheese combination is something else due to the richness of the flavor. A bonus is that every single time I've been here they have never disappointed and their cooking has been on point every time. (Yelp Rating: **4.5**) (Google Reviews **4.4**)

### Chilangos Tacos

Mexico city street style tacos is what Chilango's tacos are known for. They have proven they carry that style over to their food and theme of their restaurant. The tortilla and the meat are something very different than other places.

### El Atoron

### Fuel City

In the heart of Downtown Dallas you can find one of the most interesting places to eat tacos. Gas station tacos are very popular and even better when you can eat them on the go.
