Welcoming 2020 with our first post about our personal top 5 taco list for you to try!. The list is an unordered list.

### **La Salsa Verde Taqueria**

Before we started blogging this spot has been my all time personal favorite. The main attraction is the "Fajiqueso" tacos. A combination of melted cheese and fajita along with 3 different types of salsas to choose from. The meat with cheese combination is something else due to the richness of the flavor. A bonus is that every single time I've been here they have never disappointed and their cooking has been on point every time. (Yelp Rating: **4.5**) (Google Reviews **4.4**)

### Chilangos Tacos

Mexico city street style tacos is what Chilango's tacos are known for. They have proven they carry that style over to their food and theme of their restaurant. The tortilla and the meat are something very different than other places.

### El Atoron

We had been hearing about this spot for a while and we finally got around to trying them. I’m glad we did! It’s a small hole in the wall place hidden in East Dallas. This place is known for their Mexico City style tacos and tortas. When I took the first bite, the taco literally melted in my mouth, the combination of handmade tortilla, carne asada and salsa was amazing! We highly recommend giving El Atoron a try! The experience we got was a memorable one! (Yelp Rating: **4**) (Google Reviews **4.3**)

### Fuel City

In the heart of Downtown Dallas you can find one of the most interesting places to eat tacos. Gas station tacos are very popular and even better when you can eat them on the go.
