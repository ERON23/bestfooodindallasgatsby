BestFoodInDallas began as a way for us to try new foods. We were used to going out to eat on weekends and would tend to always stick to a routine of either tacos or wings nothing else. We wanted to venture out into new places and share our experiences with others. It began as a way for us to find and try interesting foods around our community. At first, we would share our pictures on our personal Snapchat for our friends and family to see. As we continued to do this, we wanted to expand our audience and serve as a guide for food options around Dallas. Thatâ€™s how we thought about expanding into Instagram, for others to find our page and interact with us. Now we are venturing into finding the hole in the wall places, different cultural foods, hidden coffee shops and overall we have become open to trying anything!
